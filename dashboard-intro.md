# Welcome

This dashboard collects and analyzes biogeochemical and physical data that affect the aquacultural productivity of the Nomilo fishpond, operated by [Kauaʻi Sea Farm (KSF)](https://kauaiseafarm.com/), to monitor its ecosystem and make informed management decisions aimed at restoring the fishpond and sustaining ecosystem services amid climate change.

#### Datasets Used

1. Water Sampling
2. Profiles
3. Clam growth
4. Oyster growth
5. Weather
6. KSF Data

#### Gain Insights In

1. Cell growth changes
2. Nutrient spikes
3. Water stratification volatility
4. Clam/oyster growth trends

#### Monitoring Recommendation

Measurements should be taken year-round to compare seasonal dynamics, especially contrasting summer and winter. This will help KSF grasp how climate change impacts Nomilo.
